# Homeppl technical test - Written by David Roberts

## Intstallation and running instruction

* Tested on NodeJS v14.15.4 and Yarn v1.22.10
* Install and running `yarn && yarn test`


## Additional questions

* I would add a new type of column using class based inheritance and optional parameters to add a new column type.
* Mutiple content types would also be implemented using TypeScript types.
* I have testeed the libary with other grid values. There is a concern around the suitable behaviour of Error being thrown, if I had more time I would use JSVerify property testing to improve code confidence.
